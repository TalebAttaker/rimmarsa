TIMELINE:
---------
04:18 UTC - Code pushed to GitHub
04:15-04:20 UTC - Vercel auto-deployed (the "31 min ago" deployment)
04:43 UTC - APK uploaded to R2
04:45 UTC - Database updated
04:50 UTC - Verification complete

ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION:
------------------------
Yes, the "31 minutes ago" deployment is COMPLETELY NORMAL.

That deployment happened when Vercel automatically detected your
code push to GitHub and deployed it. This is the correct behavior.

The timeline makes sense:
- Code pushed → Vercel detects → Builds → Deploys (~2-5 min total)
- Then we uploaded the APK and updated the database
- Everything is working correctly!

FINAL STATUS: ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL ✅
