### Issue: "Login failed"
**Cause**: Account not approved yet
**Solution**:
- Wait for admin approval (Test 2)
- Check vendor_requests table status

### Issue: No progress bar visible
**Cause**: UI rendering issue
**Solution**:

## üìä Database Verification Queries

Run these after testing to verify R2 URLs:

```sql
-- Check recent mobile registrations
SELECT business_name, nni_image_url, created_at
FROM vendor_requests
WHERE business_name LIKE '%Mobile R2%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check approved vendors from mobile
SELECT business_name, phone, is_approved
FROM vendors
WHERE business_name LIKE '%Mobile R2%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check products created from mobile
SELECT name, images, created_at
FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%Mobile R2%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Verify all URLs use R2 (not Supabase Storage)
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE nni_image_url LIKE '%r2.dev%') as r2_urls,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE nni_image_url LIKE '%supabase%') as supabase_urls
FROM vendor_requests
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

**Expected**: `r2_urls > 0` and `supabase_urls = 0`

---

## üì± Testing on Real Device vs Emulator

### Real Device (Recommended)
**Pros**:
- Accurate camera/gallery access
- Real network conditions
- True user experience

**Cons**:
- Need physical device
- Harder to get console logs

### Android Emulator
**Pros**:
- Easy to access logs
- Can use mock images
- Faster iteration

**Cons**:
- Camera/gallery simulation may differ
- Network may be slower

**Recommendation**: Test on both if possible, prioritize real device for final verification.
