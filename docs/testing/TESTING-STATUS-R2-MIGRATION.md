**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Production URL**: https://www.rimmarsa.com
**Status**: ✅ Automated Tests Passed, Manual Testing Required

---

## ✅ Automated Tests Completed

### 1. API Endpoint Health Checks

#### Upload Endpoint
```bash
curl https://www.rimmarsa.com/api/upload-vendor-image
```

**Result**: ✅ PASS
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Secure vendor image upload endpoint is ready",
  "security": {
    "token_required": true,
    "max_file_size": "10MB",
    "allowed_types": ["image/jpeg", "image/jpg", "image/png", "image/webp"],
    "file_signature_validation": true
  },
  "acceptedTypes": ["nni", "personal", "store", "payment", "logo", "product"]
}
```

#### Token Request Endpoint
```bash
curl https://www.rimmarsa.com/api/vendor/request-upload-token
```

**Result**: ✅ PASS
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Upload token request endpoint is ready"
}
```

---

### 2. Token Generation Test

**Result**: ✅ PASS

```json
{
  "token": "086a906dc517b8afee317c3cf8f9afc443324b35038b11fa708f3a590f64f05a",
  "expires_at": "2025-10-27T02:39:14.75+00:00",
  "max_uploads": 4
}
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Token is 64-character hex string
- ✅ Expiry time is 1 hour from creation
- ✅ Max uploads correctly set to 4
- ✅ Token format matches expected pattern

---

### 3. Security Validation Test

**Test**: Upload random data (not a valid image)

**Result**: ✅ PASS (correctly rejected)

```json
{
  "error": "File content does not match declared type. Possible malicious file detected."
}
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ File signature validation working
- ✅ Magic number checking active
- ✅ Malicious file detection functional
- ✅ Security layer protecting R2 bucket

---

### 4. Database Status Check

**Query**: Check existing vendors
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_vendors,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN is_approved THEN 1 END) as approved_vendors,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN is_active THEN 1 END) as active_vendors
FROM vendors;
```

**Result**: ✅ Database accessible
- Total vendors: 5
- Approved vendors: 1
- Active vendors: 5

**Query**: Check recent uploads (last 24 hours)
```sql
SELECT * FROM vendor_requests
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

**Result**: No new registrations in last 24 hours (expected after migration)

---

### 5. R2 Public URL Check

**Test**: Check R2 bucket accessibility
```bash
curl -I https://pub-6cf3ef49a27d47f7bc38b12620f38013.r2.dev/
```

**Result**: ✅ PASS
- HTTP/1.1 404 (expected - no files yet)
- Server: cloudflare
- Domain is accessible via Cloudflare CDN

## ⏳ Manual Testing Required

The following tests require browser interaction and cannot be automated:

### Test 1: Vendor Registration Flow

**Objective**: Verify new vendor registration uploads images to R2

**Steps**:
1. Open https://www.rimmarsa.com/vendor-registration
2. Fill out registration form (all 4 steps)
3. Upload 4 images:
   - National ID (NNI)
   - Personal photo
   - Store photo
   - Payment screenshot
4. Watch browser console for R2 URLs
5. Submit registration

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Upload progress shows for each image (0-100%)
- ✅ Console logs: "Uploaded {type} to R2: https://pub-6cf3ef49a27d47f7bc38b12620f38013.r2.dev/..."
- ✅ Success toast: "تم تحميل الصورة بنجاح!"
- ✅ Form submission succeeds

**Verification SQL**:
```sql
SELECT business_name, nni_image_url, personal_image_url,
       store_image_url, payment_screenshot_url
FROM vendor_requests
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**Check**: All image URLs should start with `https://pub-6cf3ef49a27d47f7bc38b12620f38013.r2.dev/`

### Test 2: Admin Vendor Approval

**Objective**: Verify admin can view and approve vendor requests

**Steps**:
1. Login to admin panel: https://www.rimmarsa.com/fassalapremierprojectbsk/login
2. Navigate to: Vendor Requests
3. Click on pending request from Test 1
4. Verify all 4 images load from R2
5. Click "Approve" button

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All images display correctly (no CORS errors)
- ✅ Images load from R2 domain
- ✅ Approval succeeds
- ✅ Vendor account created

**Verification SQL**:
```sql
SELECT v.business_name, v.is_approved, v.logo_url,
       vr.status, vr.nni_image_url
FROM vendors v
LEFT JOIN vendor_requests vr ON vr.vendor_id = v.id
WHERE v.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes'
ORDER BY v.created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### Test 3: Admin Vendor Management

**Objective**: Test admin uploading logo/pictures to R2

**Steps**:

- ✅ Images display immediately

**Verification SQL**:
```sql
SELECT business_name, logo_url, personal_picture_url

ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**Check**: Both URLs should use R2 domain

   - Product name
   - Category
   - Price
   - Description
3. Upload 2-3 product images
4. Watch console for upload progress
5. Click "Save Product"

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Each image shows upload progress

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Upload token required"
**Cause**: Token not generated or expired
**Solution**: Check token request endpoint, verify rate limiting not exceeded

### Issue: "Invalid file type"
**Cause**: File is not JPEG, PNG, or WebP
**Solution**: Convert image or use supported format

### Issue: "File too large"
**Cause**: Image exceeds 10MB limit
**Solution**: Compress image before upload

### Issue: Images not loading (404)
**Cause**: CORS not configured or wrong URL
**Solution**: Check R2 bucket CORS configuration

### Issue: "File content does not match declared type"
**Cause**: File signature validation failed
**Solution**: Ensure file is valid image, not corrupted
