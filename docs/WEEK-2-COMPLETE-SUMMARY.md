## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Script Consolidation (32 scripts organized)

**Moved from scattered locations to organized `/scripts/` structure:**

```
scripts/
├── mobile-app/        20 files - Build, deploy, upload scripts
├── marketplace/        1 file  - Deployment scripts
├── database/           3 files - Database setup & migrations
├── setup/              2 files - Project setup
└── utilities/          6 files - Helper tools & dev CLI
```

**Before:** Scripts in mobile-app/, marketplace/, root
**After:** All scripts in `/scripts/` with logical categorization

### 2. ✅ Root Directory Cleanup

**Before (Week 1 end):**
- 5 markdown documentation files
- 3 JSON task files
- Various unorganized files

**After (Week 2 end):**
- README.md (project overview)
- package.json (dependencies)
- package-lock.json (lock file)

**Cleanup:** 100% of non-essential files moved to organized locations

### 3. ✅ Enhanced .gitignore (80+ patterns)

**Added comprehensive security patterns:**
- Credentials: *.pem, *.key, *.cert, *credentials*.json

   - Renames tracked properly
   - History intact for debugging

3. ✅ **Developer Tools First**
   - Created helper scripts early
   - Immediate productivity boost
   - Team adoption was fast

4. ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Every change documented
   - Clear before/after comparisons
   - Metrics to show impact

5. ✅ **Service Layer Pattern**

### What Could Be Improved

1. ⚠️ **Script Consolidation**
   - Still have 15+ build scripts
   - Could reduce to 5 with better parameters
   - Next phase opportunity

2. ⚠️ **Testing Coverage**
   - No automated tests for scripts
   - Some services lack tests
   - Add in Week 3

3. ⚠️ **CI/CD Integration**
