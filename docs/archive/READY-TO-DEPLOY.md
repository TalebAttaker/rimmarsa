### 3. Upload Scripts Created
Three ready-to-use scripts have been created:

|--------|----------|
| **QUICK-UPLOAD-V1.3.0.sh** | Interactive menu with authentication guidance (EASIEST) |
| **UPLOAD-APK-TO-R2.sh** | Core upload with auto-verification and database update |
| **CLOUDFLARE-R2-UPLOAD-GUIDE.md** | Complete documentation with all authentication methods |

## Next Step: Upload APK to R2

### Easiest Method - Run This One Command:

```bash
bash /home/taleb/rimmarsa/QUICK-UPLOAD-V1.3.0.sh
```

This will:
1. Check if you're authenticated with Cloudflare
2. Guide you through authentication if needed (browser or API token)
3. Upload the APK to R2
4. Verify the upload succeeded
5. Update the database automatically
6. Confirm deployment is complete

### What Happens After Upload

Once the APK is uploaded to R2:
- âœ… Website will show v1.3.0 on the download page
- âœ… API will return v1.3.0 information
- âœ… Users can download v1.3.0 with one click
- âœ… Mobile app will show update notification to existing users

## Why Authentication is Needed

The Cloudflare wrangler CLI tokens expired on October 25, 2025. You need to re-authenticate using one of:

1. **Interactive Browser Login** (easiest)
   ```bash
   npx wrangler@latest login
   ```

2. **API Token** (no browser required)
   - Get from: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
   - Permission needed: Account > R2 Storage > Edit
   ```bash
   export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your-token-here"
   ```

3. **Dashboard Upload** (manual, but works immediately)
   - Upload via: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
   - See guide: `/home/taleb/rimmarsa/CLOUDFLARE-R2-UPLOAD-GUIDE.md`
