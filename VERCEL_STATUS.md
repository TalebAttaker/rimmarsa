# Vercel Deployment Status - Rimmarsa.com

## Current Situation

**DNS Status:** ✅ Working - rimmarsa.com is pointing to Vercel
**Domain Verification:** ✅ Complete - Both rimmarsa.com and www.rimmarsa.com verified
**Environment Variables:** ✅ Added - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY configured
**Build Status:** ❌ FAILING - All recent deployments are failing to build

---

## What I Fixed

1. **Reactivated Vercel Account** - You added payment method and reactivated
2. **Added Environment Variables** - Both Supabase credentials added via API
3. **Configured Root Directory** - Set to `marketplace` folder
4. **Removed Turbopack Flag** - Removed `--turbopack` from build command for compatibility
5. **DNS Configuration** - Already pointing to Vercel correctly

## Current Problem

**All deployments are failing with ERROR status.**

Recent deployment attempts:
- dpl_8baWzVXVBSq4zq5VrZGJaW9VdMKs - ERROR
- dpl_mRujyBK9CBYfR4ueTpDeVDSqb2Ba - ERROR
- dpl_BgDBk1pnusFpM3R7Z8z9NDDdmqnz - ERROR
- dpl_95eLnB7zAjvL4FYYx3tpFPVZeUq8 - ERROR

**There WAS a successful deployment:**
- dpl_BiSv3h2JiooiCLbh1jrb6PmWTn45 - READY (from earlier commit)

## Why Your Site Shows GoDaddy

The site shows GoDaddy's default page OR "Page Not Found" because:
1. DNS is pointing to Vercel ✅
2. BUT there's no successful production deployment
3. Vercel returns 404 when no deployment is available

## Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Manual Vercel Dashboard Fix (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/taleb-ahmeds-projects/rimmarsa
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Look at the latest failed deployment
4. Click on it to see the build logs
5. Find the actual error message (scroll through the logs)
6. Share the error with me and I can fix the code

### Option 2: Check Build Logs via Dashboard

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → rimmarsa project
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Click on the latest deployment (top one)
4. Look for red error messages in the build output
5. Common issues to look for:
   - Missing dependencies
   - TypeScript errors
   - Next.js configuration errors
   - Build timeout

### Option 3: Rollback to Working Deployment

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → rimmarsa project
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Find an older deployment with green checkmark (READY status)
4. Click three dots `...` next to it
5. Click "Promote to Production"

## Why I Can't See the Error

Vercel's API doesn't return detailed error messages. The deployment logs are only visible in the dashboard UI. That's why I need you to check the dashboard and share the error message.
