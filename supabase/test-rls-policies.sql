-- Test 1: Vendor Product Isolation
-- =========================================
-- This test verifies that vendors can only see their own products

COMMENT ON TEST 'Test 1: Vendor Product Isolation' IS '
Expected Behavior:
- When querying as Vendor A, should see only Vendor A products (2 products)
- When querying as Vendor B, should see only Vendor B products (2 products)
- Cross-vendor data access should be blocked by RLS

To test manually:
1. Login as Vendor A in the mobile app
2. Go to Products screen
3. Count products shown
4. Should see ONLY products created by Vendor A

-- Test Vendor A    | 2             | {Product A1, Product A2}
-- Test Vendor B    | 2             | {Product B1, Product B2}

-- Test 2: Public Product Visibility
-- =========================================
-- This test verifies that public users can only see approved products from verified vendors

-- Test 6: Subscription History Isolation

-- Test Vendor B    | 1_month   | 5000   | active
